React CSS Portfolio
This project is a simple portfolio website built using React and CSS. It includes a Home page, an About Me section, a Projects section, and a Contact form. The website uses basic React components and CSS styling to create a clean and responsive layout.

Each section is separated into different components. The navigation bar allows smooth scrolling between the sections. Styling is done using external CSS files to maintain a consistent and organized design.

The main focus of this project is on creating a personal portfolio using simple React structure and applying responsive design principles with CSS.
